# Simple Markdown Previewer with React

### Things I've learned:
   1. How to create a simple markdown editor that can parse the input for preview
   2. Create a react boiler plate after installing it with npm
   3. Slowly read documentation for better understanding of the npm package (marked.js)

### Things that slow me down:
   1. Parsing text from the textarea to valid markdown
   2. Skim too fast through documentation without grasping the correct infomation (slowdown)
   3. Read the requirements carefully
   4. Finding relevants information that could have helped me finish this project faster.
