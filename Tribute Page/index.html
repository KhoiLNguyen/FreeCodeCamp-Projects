Jin-Woo is also shown to be an intelligent person, being able to stay calm under pressure as he figured out the clues to fighting the boss of the Double Dungeon while most of the experienced hunters in their party panicked and were killed by the statues when they were trying to escape. 

After being Reawakened he strives to become a stronger hunter than before. Because of this, Jin-Woo became focused on getting his daily missions done. He is also focused on going to dungeons to level up. but he is still kind to the people that are important to him. 

Although Jin-Woo was shown to be indifferent when it to money, wealth and even humanly desires, he admitted to inadvertently took a peek at Hae-In's naked form after unwisely using 'Sensory Sharing' through the Shadow Soldier inserted into her shadow.</p>

    <p class="lead">Jin-Woo is the eldest child in his family. After his father, Il-Hwan disappeared inside an unknown gate, Jin-Woo took all the responsibilities for his sister, Jin-Ah and Kyung-He, his mother.

He worked as an E-Ranked Hunter under the Korean Hunters Association for 4 years, then after the Double Dungeon incident, Jin-Woo became a Player and a Reawakened Hunter.</p>
